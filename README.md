# smart-home-energy
Overview
This project is a web-based Energy Monitoring Dashboard that helps users track and manage their energy usage. It includes a graphical representation of energy consumption, a budgeting tool, and a table displaying recent energy usage data.

Files Included
index.html – The main dashboard interface containing a chart, energy budget input, and usage table.
styles.css – Stylesheet providing layout and design for the dashboard.
post-energy.php – A backend script (PHP) likely responsible for handling energy data submissions (not yet reviewed).
Features
Energy Usage Chart

Displays energy consumption visually using Chart.js.
Energy Budget Settings

Allows users to set an energy usage budget and check their status.
Recent Energy Usage Table

Shows a list of appliances with energy consumption data and timestamps.
Setup & Usage
Open index.html in a browser.
Ensure styles.css is in the same directory for proper styling.
If post-energy.php is used for backend data processing, host it on a PHP-enabled server.
Include a JavaScript file (script.js) to fetch and update data dynamically (currently missing).
Dependencies
Chart.js (included via CDN) for energy usage visualization.
Notes
The project lacks script.js, which would be responsible for dynamic data handling.
Ensure post-energy.php is correctly configured to store or process energy usage data.
